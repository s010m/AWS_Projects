**Description** : Making an End-to-End AWS Web Application to calculate exponential power of a number

**Services Used:**
1. AWS Amplify
2. AWS Lambda
3. Amazon API Gateway
4. Amazon DynamoDB
5. AWS IAM

**What we did:**
1. Hosted a WebPage using AWS Amplify service.
2. Created a function to calculate power of number using AWS Lambda service.
3. Build a REST Api to trigger maths function in Lambda with API call using AWS API-Gateway service.
4. Created database table to store result using AWS DynamoDB Service.
5. Created Inline policy to give permission to Lambda function to write in database.

**Conclusion:**
We created a fully-functional math web application using Amplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway and DynamoDB services.
